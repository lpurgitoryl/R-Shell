## Introduction
The R'Shell (command shell written in C++) will be able to preform the following:

1. Print a command prompt starting with `$`.
2. Read in a line of command(s) and/or connector(s) from user input.  

3. Execute the appropriate commands using `fork`, `execvp`, and `waitpid`.
4. Repeat the above until an exit command is executed.  

This will be done by using **enter class brakedown here**.

The general structure of the commands avalible for input will be in this form.
```
$ executable [argumentList] [connector] [executable] ...
```
